## v0.3.10 - 2025-10-07

Stability, HACS rendering reliability, and auto-restart simplification

Changes since v0.3.6

- Auto‑restart behavior simplified and hardened
	- Fixed daily restart time to 03:00 (local timezone)
	- Kept an Options checkbox to enable/disable the feature; removed time picker step from setup/options
	- Removed non-essential success/schedule/updated/disabled notifications; kept a failure notification after retries
	- Cleaned up strings/translations and help text to avoid implying the time can be chosen
	- Improved scheduling logic and logging

- HACS README rendering and release flow improvements
	- Ensured README header version is updated for both Markdown and HTML variants in release.sh to prevent mismatches in HACS
	- Standardized version stamping across manifest.json (vX.Y.Z), info.md, and hacs.json
	- Documentation/content updates and cleanup in README (installation and setup)
	- Excluded release tooling files from HACS downloads via hacs.json ignore list

- General maintenance
	- Multiple small doc/layout cleanups between v0.3.6 → v0.3.10
	- Internal release script robustness improvements
